## Overview
Interaction with the smart contract is provided by calling smart contract functions with parameters.  
* First, you need to find out the `address` of the smart contract.
* With the address, you can get the `ABI interface`.
* Using the `ABI` you can call the target `function` of the smart contract.

## Obtaining the ABI interface

1. Go to the [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io).
2. Enter smart contract address in the field `Search by address` and click `Search` button.
3. Go to the `Contract` section.

4. Click `Code` button

## How to read contract information using Etherscan
The most convinient way to read information about smart contract is to use interface provided by [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io).  
The first steps are similar to those described in the section [Obtaining the ABI interface](#obtaining-the-abi-interface):
1. Go to the [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io).
2. Enter smart contract address in the field `Search by address` and click `Search` button.
3. Go to the `Contract` section.
4. Click `Read Contract` button. Now you can access contract's public information. You don't need to create a transaction to `read` the contract.

5. In the MetaMask window, select the address you want to use. Since all administrative functions of the smart contract are protected from being called by unauthorized persons, this must be the address of the smart contract's owner.

## How to set price in the CommonSale smart contract
The final price that users pay when buying a tokens is calculated from the following two parameters:
1) `Base price`. Common to all stages of the sale.
2) `Bonus in %`, which is applied to the number of tokens received upon purchase. Set separately for each stage of the sale.

> Attention! The `Base price` value is the amount of tokens that user receives for 1 ETH.

In the case when you need to adjust the ETH price of a token relative to its price in USD, we recommend using the `setPrice` function.  
Please, use the `Stages` tab of the `Candao` spreadsheet. You can find the parameter value that needs to be passed to the `setPrice` function in cell `N8`.  
The value in cell `N8` is calculated automatically from the value of the `ETH_USD` currency pair, which is regularly updated via `GOOGLEFINANCE`.

1. Follow steps 1-6 of the [Calling function](#calling-function) section.
2. Fill `newPrice` field.

3. Click `Write` button and then click `Confirm` button, as described in step 7 of the [Calling function](#calling-function) section.

## How to update stage parameters in the CommonSale smart contract
Each stage of the sale is configured with the following parameters:
1) `id` - zero-based (the first stage has index `0`) index of stage. Use this value to select the exact stage you want to edit.
2) `start` - unix timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the stage.
2) `end` - unix timestamp (in seconds) of the end of the stage.
2) `bonus` - the `Base price` value is the amount of tokens that user gets for 1 ETH.
2) `minInvestmentLimit` - the mininum amount of `Wei` that user should send to the `CommonSale` contract to buy tokens.
2) `hardcapInTokens` - the maximum amount of tokens that can be sold during the stage.
   
Please, use the `Stages` tab of the `Candao` spreadsheet. You can find the parameters that need to be passed to the `updateStage` function in columns from `O` to `T`.
The value in columns `O`-`T` are automatically calculated from values set in columns `D` - `K`

1. Follow steps 1-6 of the [Calling function](#calling-function) section.
2. Fill `newPrice` field.

## How to withdraw tokens from freezeWallet
The FreezeWallet contract makes tokens available for withdrawal according to schedule described in `Wallets` tab of `Candao` spreadsheet.
In order to get released tokens wallet owner should [call](#calling-function) `retrieveWalletTokens` function with the target address passed as a parameter.
You can specify any address as `target` for receiving tokens.
